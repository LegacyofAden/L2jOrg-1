Trader Holly:
<br>Welcome to our store! Do you enjoy your visit to the capital? Although it seems safe and secure from the outside, the city actually faces big problems. Some noblemen and the warrior clique conspire to usurp the throne. Unless we get rid of them quickly, they will lead our country to ruin... 
<br>Oh, what do I know? Forget all I've just said. Come here.
