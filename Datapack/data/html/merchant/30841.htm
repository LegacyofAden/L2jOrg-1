Trader Carson:
<br>Welcome, valued customer! Is there anything specific you're looking for today? We have a wide selection of earrings, necklaces, rings, and much, much more! If it's worth coveting, we've got it! That's the difference between Elmore and Aden, eh? Here in Aden, we believe elegance is always worth the price -- not like those savages to the north! Well, have a look around. Whatever your budget, I'm sure you'll find something that pleases you.
