Ask, and you shall be answered! 
<br>I like your curiosity. So here's the deal: 
<br>Each magical symbol forms a harmonious triangle of 3 stats. 
<br>STR, DEX, and CON will form six forms of harmony, as will INT, MEN, and WIT.
<br>And in order to withstand that harmony, you need power. That's why advanced classes can use more advanced symbols.
