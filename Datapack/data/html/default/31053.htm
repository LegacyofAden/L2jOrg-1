<html> <body>  Hello! Isn't it a beautiful day?
<br>Would you like to have a symbol made?
<br1> Have you brought dye?
<br>Symbols are not easily made!
<br>You must be certain of what you want before we begin! This is an expensive project and you cannot afford any false starts!
<br>Although expensive, if you choose well, your symbol will be a good investment for you, as valuable as an excellent sword or shield!
