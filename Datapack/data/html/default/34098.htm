<html><head><body>Sora: 
<br>I came across a room by chance. There was a terrifying Steward holding the key, managing that place. 
<br>Inside that room, there was the ancient Pirate Captain Goldberg. Just like the legend, he was super big and scary. It will be hard to deal with him by yourself. 
<br>If you got the ‘Goldberg's Room Key' from the Steward, I'll send you there.
