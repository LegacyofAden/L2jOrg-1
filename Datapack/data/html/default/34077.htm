<br> We were sailing in peace. Then the sky darkened all of a sudden, and the waves got high, and once I woke up, we were inside a damp and dark cave. Actually, it looked more like someone had built it. 
<br> The eyes we saw in the dark weren't those of humans. It was full of atrocious things that might have once been humans. 
<br> We came out running. We escaped under the captain's orders in a frenzy, so I'm very tired. We ran to Town of Aden at full speed. I'm super tired. I'll have to calm down while resting.
